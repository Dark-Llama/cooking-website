					<h4>Making Healthier Choices</h4>
					<p>The most healthy choices you can make is eating foods with unsaturated fats rather than saturated fats, foods that are low in sodium (salt), foods with little extra added sugar and foods that are less processed.</p>

					<h4>Make sensible portion choices</h4>
					<p>You can use your hand to check your portions. For fruit and vegetables, your two hands cupped together is a good portion size. For more starchy foods and grains a closed fist is a better representation. For fish your hand or one fillet, and for meat a good guide is the palm of your hand.</p>
